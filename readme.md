## Assignment Overview

What is the assignment about?  
Purpose was to familiarize ourselves with using heaps and binary trees.

Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.
 The purpose of q1 was to learn trees where we aranged nodes based on left, parent, right. write an expression in preorder, post order, in order, and be able to compute the expressions when given the values of all variables.

The purpose of q2 was to make us comfrtable with using heaps. Using a f.dat file use keys found frim the files to reorder rows using the function downHeap. Swapped rows to match heap ording in the 2D array.

## Resources
Did you use any resources (for example book, notes etc) in this assignment?

For this assignment I used lecture slides to understand how to implement binary trees and heaps. I also used lab material to review how to run and create a makefile. I also used online resources like Geeks for Geeks, and Stack overflow on how to free memory.

## Implementation
Is the assignment complete? If not, mention what part of the assignment is missing or incomplete. 
Yes it is complete all work has been done.

## Errors Faced

I faced some errors in Q1 and Q2 which is one you may notice some extra lines of code i used to check for errors. like in my q2 downHeap function you may notice the print statment, I added that because i was getting errors where my output was the exact same as the input array. added that print statment showed me what the values were before and after the swaps and i noticed nothing was changing and that my downHeap function needed to be fixed. Same for q1 i have a print statment in the first function where i print memory allocation failed as i was having issues with memory allocation for q1. But the current version of Both questions works as intended.
